# Arpy

Can't be bothered to watch a tcpdump filter to work out an available IP address?

Try arpy.

## Installation

Grab this repo, and install scapy if you don't have it already. I'm using the AsyncSniffer, so you will want to install scapy v2.4.3 or greater.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:michaelranaldo/arpy
pip install scapy
sudo python3.x arpy.py
```

Python 3, requires sudo.
